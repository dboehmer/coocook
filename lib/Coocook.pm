#         -Debug: activates the debug mode for very useful log messages
#   ConfigLoader: will load the configuration from a Config::General file in the
#                 application's home directory
# Static::Simple: will serve static files from the application's root
#                 directory

# over this when using ConfigLoader. Thus configuration
# details given here can function as a default configuration,
# with an external configuration file acting as an override for
# local deployment.
