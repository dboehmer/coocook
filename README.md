## Quick start

Get source code:

    $ git clone https://github.com/dboehmer/coocook.git

### Configure database

Copy the config template [`share/examples/dbic.yaml`](share/examples/dbic.yaml) to the working directory:

    $ cp share/examples/dbic.yaml dbic.yaml

A database from the YAML file other than `development` or a literal DSN can be configured in `coocook_local.yaml`.
For other possible settings see the default values defined in [`lib/Coocook.pm`](lib/Coocook.pm).

### Run with native Perl (works best on Unix-like Operating Systems)

Prerequisites:

* [Perl5](https://www.perl.org/get.html)
  with [`cpanm`](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus#INSTALLATION)

* by default [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
  with [`DBD::SQLite`](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::SQLite)
  or some other RDBMS

With Ubuntu or Debian Linux:

    $ sudo apt-get install cpanminus libdbd-sqlite3-perl sqlite3

Install Perl5 dependencies required for running the application:

    $ cd coocook/
    $ cpanm --installdeps .

For development purposes there are a few *recommended* and *suggested* dependencies. To install these as well run:

    $ cpanm --with-develop --with-recommends --with-suggests --installdeps .

Install database schema into configured database (see above) and start development server in debug mode:

    $ script/coocook_deploy.pl install
    $ script/coocook_server.pl --debug
    ...
    HTTP::Server::PSGI: Accepting connections at http://0:3000/

Hint: With the `--restart` option the development server restarts automatically when files in `lib/` are changed.
This requires `Catalyst::Restarter`.

### Run with Docker

Goto [https://hub.docker.com/r/coocook/coocook-dev](https://hub.docker.com/r/coocook/coocook-dev) and follow the instructions there to use the Dockerimage for Development.
